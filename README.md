# Passwor-Generator-Cody-Polland

## Description

I was motivated to attempt a password generator because it seemed like a good foundation project to test my new found JavaScrpit skills. I wanted to get a good practive with using Javascript particularly functions, array methods, and conditional statements. Creating a password genorator solves the propblme of having to create strong and unique passwords. This Project was developed and a homework assignment for UCSD Full-Stack Web Dev Bootcamp.
